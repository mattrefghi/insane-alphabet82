# insane-alphabet82
A TI-82 game where you try to survive as long as possible against an onslaught of alphabet characters.

## History
I wrote this software for the TI-82 back when I was in college, and was pleasantly surprised to find the source code on one of my backup DVDs. The version on GitHub today is what I labelled as Beta v1.0 (dated June 19, 2003) back then.
